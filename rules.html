          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>The staff reserves the right to modify rules, enforcement procedures, and penalties at their discretion, with or without prior notice. Violating the spirit of the rules can lead to penalties equivalent to not adhering to the rules themselves.</p>
            <p>Personal attacks, insults outside of roleplay scenarios, and any form of harassment are strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban.</p>
            <p>Racism, sexism, hate speech, and any other form of discriminatory or abusive language will not be tolerated and will result in an immediate permanent ban. Although Las Islas Filipinas exists in an alternate universe, any roleplay involving oppression, slavery, or prostitution is strictly prohibited under any circumstances. Additionally, historical events may have unfolded differently in this universe, and roleplay promoting violence based on gender, race, or similar factors will not be accepted.</p>

          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Basic Community Guidelines</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>While Las Islas Filipinas is a Philippine-based server, all communication during roleplay (RP) must be conducted in either Filipino or English. Clear communication between players is expected at all times, and any deliberate avoidance of RP communication may be viewed as "Avoiding RP," which could result in sanctions.</p>
            <p>Las Islas Filipinas is an 18+ community due to the sensitive content, mature themes, and explicit language that may arise during both gameplay and roleplay scenarios on the server. By participating, players acknowledge and agree to these conditions.</p>
            <p>Effective communication is crucial to maintaining an immersive roleplay experience. To ensure smooth and engaging scenarios, players are encouraged to use a good quality microphone. This helps avoid disruptions and enhances the overall roleplay environment for everyone involved.</p>
            <p>If disagreements or instances of rule-breaking occur in-game, all players should attempt to resolve them through roleplay, without breaking character. Once the scenario concludes, players may submit reports via the Support Ticket channel on the community Discord...</p>

          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Bans and other Disciplinary Procedures</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Las Islas Filipinas has an internal review process that oversees all disciplinary evaluations and decisions. All bans and disciplinary actions are determined through a majority vote by the staff members.</p>
            <p>Disciplinary actions are final. However, individuals who are banned may appeal their ban every 7 days. A player may only receive up to 3 bans before their ban becomes permanent.</p>
            <p>All information related to disciplinary actions is confidential between the player/players involved and the staff of Las Islas Filipinas...</p>

          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Staff Communication and Expected Conduct</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Staff members are expected to uphold the highest level of professionalism both in and out of character. This includes avoiding favoritism, harassment, or abuse of authority at all times. The community depends on staff to remain unbiased and supportive.</p>
            <p>Players who wish to dispute a staff action or decision may submit a support ticket. Staff decisions made after a final review are considered binding and will be enforced.</p>

          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Character Creation and Persona</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Characters must be realistic and grounded within the world of Las Islas Filipinas. Over-the-top, meme, or troll characters are not permitted. Players are encouraged to flesh out backstories, cultural ties, and motivations.</p>
            <p>Characters must reflect human personas. Non-human or supernatural characters are not permitted unless approved for lore purposes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="names">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Character and Organization Names</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Character names should be culturally appropriate, avoid offensive meanings, and fit within the setting. Joke names, celebrity names, or unrealistic aliases are not allowed.</p>
            <p>Organization names must follow the same logic. Staff reserves the right to reject or request changes to names deemed immersion-breaking or inappropriate.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="downed">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Downed, Unconscious and Permadeath</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Players who are downed (unconscious) must not speak in VOIP or provide information unless a doctor is present in RP. Downed characters are not to metagame or direct others.</p>
            <p>Permadeath is only required when staff declares it after repeated violations, lore events, or coordinated conflict arcs. Players may voluntarily choose to permadeath (PK) their character as part of a story conclusion.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="rules-collapse" id="value">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Value of Life</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>All players must roleplay fear and value for their character's life in situations where their survival is at risk. This includes complying with threats when clearly outnumbered or outgunned.</p>
            <p>Failure to roleplay appropriate fear in high-stakes or life-threatening scenarios may be considered FailRP and can lead to disciplinary action.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="rdm">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Random Death Match</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>RDM refers to initiating combat or killing another player without proper roleplay context or escalation. All combat must be preceded by a valid RP scenario or motive.</p>
            <p>Attacking or killing another player without prior verbal interaction, threat, or meaningful reason is considered RDM and will result in penalties.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="shootouts">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Shootouts</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Shootouts should be meaningful, story-driven, and not treated as casual or random events. Characters involved must have strong IC motivation for participating in gunplay.</p>
            <p>Public shootouts must consider civilian impact and server performance. Avoid excessive or unrealistic mass gunfights.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="meta">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Meta Gaming</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Metagaming is using information your character did not learn in character (IC) to influence their decisions or actions. This includes using Discord, Twitch streams, or private messages to gather RP info.</p>
            <p>Sharing or acting on OOC knowledge IC is strictly prohibited and is one of the most serious offenses in the server.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="rules-collapse" id="power">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Power Gaming</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Powergaming is forcing actions on others without giving them a chance to respond or roleplay. This includes overusing mechanics (like hogtie), ignoring injuries, or playing as invincible characters.</p>
            <p>Always allow room for other players to react and avoid actions that eliminate another player's agency or freedom to RP.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="roping">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Roping and Hog Tie</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Hogtie and lasso mechanics are powerful tools and must be used responsibly. You must build RP before using them — do not start encounters by immediately roping someone.</p>
            <p>Captives must not break out unless there’s a reasonable chance, such as being left alone or during a major distraction.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="gangs">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Group Size and Criminal Organization Rules</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Criminal groups are limited to 6 players in PvP situations. Larger groups must split into separate factions. PvP limits ensure fair fights and server performance.</p>
            <p>If your gang is above the limit, communicate who’s involved before conflict begins. Civilians hired by gangs must not engage in illegal activity unless clearly roleplayed as affiliates.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="civ-law">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Non-Criminal Civilians and Law Group Size in Combat Scenario</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Non-criminal and law enforcement groups are limited to 6 armed members in any combat. If more are present, uninvolved members must retreat or spectate passively.</p>
            <p>Larger groups may gather for patrols or events, but only 6 may fight in active shootouts unless staff grants permission for more.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="rules-collapse" id="bandits">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Formation of Bandit Groups or Criminal Organizations</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Bandit and criminal groups must have immersive storylines tied to the server's lore. Players need at least 100 in-game hours before forming or joining these groups.</p>
            <p>Group size is capped at 10, with mandatory use of in-character names. Successful criminal activity leads to bounty RP and law enforcement tracking. Criminals cannot hold legitimate jobs.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="conflict">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Conflict Initiation Rule for PvP Scenarios</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Only one group may initiate conflict at a time for a specific reason. Maximum characters in a PvP scenario is 10 per side. Coordinated third-party initiations are not allowed.</p>
            <p>Groups may defend themselves, but PvP participants are capped at 6 armed members. Extra players must leave the area.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="hostages">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Hostages</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Hostage situations must be organic and well roleplayed. You may not take staff, EMS, or disguised allies as hostages. One hostage allows 2 demands, two = 3 demands (max). No excessive or unrealistic requests.</p>
            <p>Hostages must be respected, not killed. Robbers and law enforcement must act within immersion and allow proper exchanges, chases, or shootouts to follow naturally.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="gov">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Government Employee and Criminal Activity</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Government workers (LEOs, staff, judges) must not engage in or assist criminal activities. Doing so will result in sanctions including removal from position or bans.</p>
            <p>While characters can have attitude, they must uphold professionalism and avoid compromising their role integrity. Staff may monitor these roles for immersion and fairness.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        
        <div class="rules-collapse" id="robbery">
          <button class="rules-toggle">+ Robbery and Hold-Up Roleplay</button>
          <div class="rules-panel">
            <p>Robbery RP must involve strong verbal roleplay. Robbers must introduce themselves using their in-character names and provide immersive dialogue before taking action.</p>
            <p>Victims must react with believable fear, but robbers cannot kill victims without deeper RP justification. Discretion is important — avoid robbing in public or chaotic settings.</p>
            <p>Only 4–6 robbers may participate. Robbers may only take items victims offer voluntarily (plus 1 visible weapon). Horses may not be harmed. Reward RP effort with reasonable item/money handoffs.</p>
